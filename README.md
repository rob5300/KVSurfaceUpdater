# KVSurfaceUpdater
Update Source 1 Surfaces to new KV3 sbox compatible ones

Looks in surfaceproperties files as well a decals_subrect file to make new surface files and decal files.
Created for use with SBox.

Special thanks to [justynboi](https://github.com/justynboi) for outlining how to translate the surface and decal data.
