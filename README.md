# KV1 to KV3 Updater
Update Source 1 Sounds and Surfaces to new KV3 S&Box compatible ones.

## Sounds
Most important data is converted for sounds. All sound characters are correctly removed now (thanks [MoonlyDays](https://github.com/MoonlyDays))

## Surfaces
Looks in surfaceproperties files as well a decals_subrect file to make new surface files and decal files.
Created for use with SBox.

Special thanks to [justyn0](https://github.com/justyn0) for outlining how to translate:
- Surfaces
- Decals
- Sounds
