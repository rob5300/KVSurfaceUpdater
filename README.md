# KV1 to KV3 Updater
Update Source 1 Sounds and Surfaces to new KV3 S&Box compatible ones.

## Sounds
Early days, can take some information from sounds and convert them to KV3.

## Surfaces
Looks in surfaceproperties files as well a decals_subrect file to make new surface files and decal files.
Created for use with SBox.

Special thanks to [justynboi](https://github.com/justynboi) for outlining how to translate:
- Surfaces
- Decals
- Sounds
